Welcome to my personal repository, which chronicles my journey through the [Level Up In Tech](https://levelupintech.com) program by Broadus Palmer. This program was designed to empower participants with the essential skills required for a successful career in the cloud and DevOps sectors, and I'm proud to share my accomplishments and learning experiences.

## About Level Up In Tech

Level Up In Tech, founded by Broadus Palmer, is an innovative training program that focuses on the real-world application of cloud computing, DevOps practices, and software development. The program aimed to bridge the gap between traditional education and the demands of the tech industry.

## What I Learned

Throughout this program, I delved into several critical technologies and practices that are foundational to modern cloud infrastructure and DevOps workflows:

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** I gained an in-depth understanding of the leading cloud service provider, focusing on core services such as EC2, S3, IAM, and more, to build scalable and resilient cloud infrastructure.

- **Linux (CentOS Stream 9/Red Hat 9):** I acquired hands-on experience with Linux operating systems, emphasizing the CentOS distribution, to effectively manage servers and applications.

- **Git:** I mastered version control with Git, learning how to manage code changes, collaborate in teams, and maintain a seamless development workflow.

- **Python:** I developed programming skills in Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages, to automate tasks and build efficient applications.

- **Containers (Docker/Kubernetes):** I learned about containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes to deploy, scale, and manage applications in a microservices architecture.

- **Terraform:** I learned Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform to automate the deployment and management of cloud infrastructure across multiple service providers.
